# Headjack

Headjack is a CLI tool for spawning isolated CLI-based LLM coding agents in predefined container environments. Each agent runs in its own VM-isolated container with a dedicated git worktree, enabling safe parallel development across multiple branches.

## Development Commands

Use `just` to run common development tasks:

```bash
just check    # Run all checks (format, lint, test)
just fmt      # Format code
just lint     # Run linter
just test     # Run tests
```

## Code Quality Requirements

### Go Code

All changes to Go code MUST:

1. **Pass all checks**: Run `just check` before considering any change complete
2. **Follow style guidelines**: Conform to `ref/go/style.md`
3. **Follow testing guidelines**: Conform to `ref/go/testing.md`

### Dockerfiles

All changes to Dockerfiles MUST pass hadolint:

```bash
hadolint images/base/Dockerfile
```

### Pull Requests

All PRs MUST pass CI before being considered done. Monitor PR status with:

```bash
gh pr checks <pr-number> --watch
```

Wait for all checks to pass. If checks fail, fix the issues and push again.

### Commit Messages

All commits MUST follow the Conventional Commits standard with scoped subjects and structured bodies:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

Current behavior:
<what was happening before, or "N/A - new feature" for new additions>

New behavior:
<what happens now>

Breaking Changes:
<list breaking changes, or omit section if none>

Closes: #<issue number, or omit if none>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `ci`, `test`, `style`, `perf`

**Scopes:** Infer from the primary module changed: `cli`, `auth`, `container`, `git`, `catalog`, `config`, `instance`, `logging`, `multiplexer`, `names`, `version`, `images`, `ci`

**Rules:**
- Subject: imperative mood, no period, max 50 chars
- Body sections should be concise but informative
- Do NOT explain "how" in the body - that's what the diff is for
- Omit sections that don't apply (e.g., no Breaking Changes section if none)

**Example:**

```
feat(auth): add JWT refresh token endpoint

Current behavior:
Tokens expire after 15 minutes and users are forced to log in again,
causing frustration during long sessions.

New behavior:
Implemented a silent refresh flow using a secure HTTP-only cookie.
Users now stay logged in as long as they are active.

Breaking Changes:
The `POST /login` response schema has changed. It now returns
`{ token, refreshToken }` instead of just `{ token }`.

Closes: #892
```
